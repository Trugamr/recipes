# Recipes

This repository contains Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and other deployment configurations that I use or experiment with. It primarily utilizes Traefik for reverse proxying and SSL certificate management.

Feel free to explore and use any of the configurations in this repository. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
